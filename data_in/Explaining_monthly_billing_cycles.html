    <h1>Understanding Monthly Billing Cycles</h1>
    <h2>Overview of Monthly Billing Cycles</h2>
    <p>Your monthly billing cycle refers to the period or time frame during which your telecommunications usage (including call time, data usage, and additional services) is recorded, calculated, billed, and ultimately delivered to you in the form of a statement or invoice.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Key Concept</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Billing Cycle</td>
                <td>A periodic interval, typically a month, wherein service usage is measured and billed.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Billing Date</td>
                <td>The specific day within the billing cycle when the bill is generated and sent to the customer.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Due Date</td>
                <td>The date by which payment for the bill must be made to avoid any late fees or penalties.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Pro-rated Billing</td>
                <td>Adjusting charges to reflect partial-service usage in cases of new service activation or service termination partway through the billing cycle.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Billing Cycle Structure</h2>
    <p>Understanding the structure of your billing cycles helps in managing finances effectively and ensures timely payment. Typically, a billing cycle encompasses the following phases:</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Start Date:</strong> The beginning of the billing cycle, often the day after the previous cycle's end date.</li>
        <li><strong>Usage Tracking:</strong> Throughout the billing cycle, your service usage is tracked and recorded. This includes anything from call minutes, text messages, data usage, and other subscribed services.</li>
        <li><strong>Bill Generation Date:</strong> At the end of the billing cycle, a bill is generated summarizing all charges incurred during that period.</li>
        <li><strong>Billing Statement Delivery:</strong> The bill is sent to the customer via mail, email, or posted on their online account portal.</li>
        <li><strong>Payment Due Date:</strong> Typically 15-20 days after the bill generation date, by which the payment must be made to avoid late fees.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Example of a Monthly Billing Cycle</h2>
    <p>Let’s use a concrete example to illustrate how a typical monthly billing cycle works in practice:</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Phase</th>
                <th>Date</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Start Date</td>
                <td>1st of the Month</td>
                <td>The billing cycle begins. For example, January 1st.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Usage Tracking</td>
                <td>1st - 30th of the Month</td>
                <td>All usage and charges are tracked for billing purposes.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Bill Generation Date</td>
                <td>1st of the Next Month</td>
                <td>A bill is generated summarizing the previous month's usage and charges, e.g., on February 1st.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Billing Statement Delivery</td>
                <td>1st - 5th of the Next Month</td>
                <td>The bill is sent to the customer through their chosen delivery method.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Payment Due Date</td>
                <td>20th of the Next Month</td>
                <td>The customer must pay the bill by this date to avoid any penalties, e.g., by February 20th.</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Common Customer Questions</h2>
    <p>Below are some common questions customers might ask about their billing cycle, along with suggested explanations.</p>

        <li>
            <strong>1. Why do I have to pay prorated charges?</strong><br>
            Prorated charges occur when a service is either activated or terminated partway through a billing cycle. These charges ensure that you only pay for the part of the month that you used the service.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>2. What happens if I miss my payment due date?</strong><br>
            Missing your payment due date may result in late fees, service interruptions, and potentially affect your credit score. It is crucial to make payments on time to avoid these issues.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>3. Can I change my billing cycle dates?</strong><br>
