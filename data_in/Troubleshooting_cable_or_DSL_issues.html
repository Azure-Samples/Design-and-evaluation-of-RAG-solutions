    <h2>Step-by-Step Troubleshooting Guide</h2>
    <h3>1. Basic Checks</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Check Connections:</strong> Ensure all cables are securely connected to the modem and router. Verify that power cables are plugged in and the device is turned on.</li>
        <li><strong>Power Cycle Devices:</strong> Turn off the modem and router. Wait for 30 seconds, then turn them back on. Wait for all lights to stabilize.</li>
        <li><strong>Inspect Lights:</strong> Check the status lights on the modem and router. Common indicators are:
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Power:</strong> Should be solid green.</li>
                <li><strong>Internet/DSL:</strong> Should be solid or blinking green. Red or off indicates a problem.</li>
                <li><strong>Wi-Fi:</strong> Should be solid green if the Wi-Fi is on.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Checking for Service Outages</h3>
    <div class="note">
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> If the internet light on your modem is off or red, there might be a service outage in your area.</p>
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Visit the QuickConnect service status page (<a href="https://status.quickconnect.com" target="_blank">https://status.quickconnect.com</a>) to check for known outages.</li>
        <li>You can also contact customer support at 1-800-QUICK-HELP for the latest information on service disruptions.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>3. Verifying Router and Modem Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Access Router Interface:</strong> Open a web browser and type the router's IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1). Log in using the default username and password (usually found on the router's label or manual).</li>
        <li><strong>Check Connection Status:</strong> In the router interface, navigate to the connection status page and verify that the router is receiving an IP address from your ISP (Internet Service Provider).</li>
        <li><strong>Wi-Fi Settings:</strong> Ensure your Wi-Fi network is named (SSID) and password-protected. It’s advisable to use WPA2 security for better protection.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>4. Updating Firmware and Drivers</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Modem and Router Firmware:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Check the router manufacturer’s website for the latest firmware updates.</li>
                <li>In the router interface, go to the firmware update section and follow the instructions to update.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Network Adapter Drivers (for computers):</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Visit your computer or network adapter manufacturer's website and download the latest drivers.</li>
                <li>Install the updated drivers and restart your computer.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>5. Reducing Interference</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Location:</strong> Place the modem and router in a central location, away from walls or obstructions, and higher up if possible.</        li>
        <li><strong>Channel Selection:</strong> In the router settings, change the Wi-Fi channel to one that is less congested. Channels 1, 6, and 11 are typically preferred for 2.4 GHz networks.</li>
       <li><strong>Reduce Devices:</strong> Disconnect unused devices from the network to free up bandwidth.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>6. Advanced Troubleshooting</h3>
    <h4>Resetting the Modem/Router</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Locate the reset button on your modem or router (usually a small hole that requires a paperclip to press).</li>
        <li>Press and hold the reset button for about 10 seconds.</li>
        <li>Release the reset button and allow the modem or router to reboot (this can take several minutes).</li>
        <li>Note: Resetting will restore default settings; you will need to reconfigure your Wi-Fi settings.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Contacting ISP Support</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Gather information: Note down the error messages, the type of modem/router, and any troubleshooting steps you have already tried.</li>
        <li>Call QuickConnect support at 1-800-QUICK-HELP.</li>
        <li>Provide the support agent with all the relevant information, and they will assist you further.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>DSL Specific Troubleshooting</h3>
    <h4>Checking DSL Filters</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that all devices connected to the telephone line (phones, fax machines, etc.) have DSL filters installed on the line.</li>
        <li>Unfiltered devices can cause interference and disrupt your DSL connection.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Checking Phone Line Quality</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Listen for noise: Plug a phone directly into the wall jack and listen for any static or noise that could indicate a line problem.</li>
        <li>If you hear noise, contact your telephone provider to resolve the issue.</li>
    </ul>
