      <h2 id="faq">4. Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
      <h3>Q: What should I do if my device can't connect to the Wi-Fi network?</h3>
      <p>A: Ensure that the Wi-Fi is turned on for the device and that it is within range of the router. Check the SSID and password. Restart both the device and router.</p>

      <h3>Q: How can I improve my Wi-Fi signal strength?</h3>
      <p>A: Place the router in a central location, elevate it off the ground, and ensure it is free from obstructions. Switching to a dual-band router can help too.</p>

      <h3>Q: Why is my Wi-Fi connection dropping frequently?</h3>
      <p>A: This can be due to interference, outdated router firmware, or an overcrowded channel.
