    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to the QuickConnect Customer Service Documentation. This guide is designed to help customer service agents provide clear and detailed information about QuickConnect's data caps. This document will cover what data caps are, QuickConnect's data cap policies, ways customers can manage their data usage, and answers to common questions.</p>
</section>

<section id="what-are-data-caps">
    <h2>What Are Data Caps?</h2>
    <p>Data caps, also known as data limits, are restrictions placed by internet service providers (ISPs) on the amount of data a customer can use within a billing cycle. Data caps are designed to manage network congestion and ensure equitable access to broadband services for all users.</p>

        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Data Cap</td>
            <td>A limit on data usage set by an ISP within a specific period.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Bandwidth</td>
            <td>The amount of data that can be transmitted in a set amount of time, usually measured in Mbps (Megabits per second).</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Billing Cycle</td>
            <td>The period of time between billings for service usage, typically one month.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Overage Fee</td>
            <td>A charge incurred when a customer exceeds their data cap.</td>

<section id="data-cap-policies">
    <h2>QuickConnect Data Cap Policies</h2>
    <p>QuickConnect offers a variety of internet plans, each with its own data cap. Below is a breakdown of our current data cap policies:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Basic Plan:</strong> 100 GB per month</li>
        <li><strong>Standard Plan:</strong> 300 GB per month</li>
        <li><strong>Unlimited Plan:</strong> No data cap</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In addition to these plans, QuickConnect offers <strong>rollover data</strong> for customers who do not use their full data allowance. Rollover data allows unused data from the current billing cycle to carry over to the next cycle.</p>
    <h3>Handling Overages</h3>
    <p>QuickConnect aims to be transparent and fair with overage fees. Here is our policy on data overages:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>If a customer exceeds their data cap, they will incur an overage fee of $10 per additional 50 GB.</li>
        <li>Customers can opt to receive alerts when they are nearing their data cap to help avoid overages.</li>
        <li>Customers also have the option to upgrade their plan at any time to avoid overages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p><strong>Important:</strong> Overages are only applicable to the Basic and Standard plans. The Unlimited Plan does not have a data cap and, therefore, no overage fees.</p>

<section id="managing-data-usage">
    <h2>Managing Data Usage</h2>
    <p>Customers often inquire about ways to manage their data usage to avoid overage fees. Here are some tips and best practices you can share with them:</p>
    <h3>Monitor Data Usage</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Advise customers to regularly check their data usage through the QuickConnect online portal or mobile app.</li>
        <li>Encourage setting up data usage alerts available in their QuickConnect account settings.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Optimize Streaming</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage customers to reduce video streaming quality, especially on mobile devices, to save data.</li>
        <li>Suggest downloading content for offline viewing where possible to minimize streaming.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Update Settings</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Advise turning off automatic updates for apps and software, or schedule updates during off-peak hours.</li>
        <li>Recommend disabling background data for apps that do not need to be constantly updated.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Use Wi-Fi Whenever Possible</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Encourage customers to connect to Wi-Fi networks at home and in public places to save mobile data.</li>
        <li>Inform them about configuring their mobile devices to prompt before using mobile data.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Purchase Additional Data</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>QuickConnect offers additional data packages that customers can purchase if they anticipate exceeding their cap.</li>
        <li>Let them know these packages can be added through their online account or by speaking with a customer service representative.</li>
    </ul>
