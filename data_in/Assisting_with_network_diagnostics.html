        <h2>Preliminary Checks</h2>
        <p>Before diving into advanced diagnostics, it is important to perform some preliminary checks. These steps can often resolve common issues or provide valuable information that will aid in further troubleshooting.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Verify Connectivity:</strong> Ensure that the customer's device is properly connected to the network. This includes checking for loose cables and ensuring that the device is connected to the correct Wi-Fi network.</li>
            <li><strong>Restart Devices:</strong> Sometimes, simply restarting the router, modem, or the customer's device can resolve connectivity issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Check for Global Issues:</strong> Confirm whether there is a known outage or service issue in the customer's area.</li>
            <li><strong>Update Firmware:</strong> Ensure that the router/modem firmware is up to date, as updates can resolve known issues and improve performance.</li>

        <h2>Advanced Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If the preliminary checks and common solutions do not resolve the issue, agents may need to perform advanced troubleshooting techniques. Below are some steps for advanced network diagnostics:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>ISPs and Modems:</strong> Contact the customer’s ISP to check for any service outages or specific issues related to the customer’s account. Check if the modem’s signal levels are within acceptable ranges.</li>
            <li><strong>Router Logs:</strong> Access the router logs to check for errors, disconnects, and other issues that may indicate hardware or configuration problems. </li>
            <li><strong>Device-Specific Issues:</strong> Determine if the issue is isolated to one device or affects multiple devices. For isolated issues, check the device’s network settings and drivers.</li>
            <li><strong>Subnet and VLAN Configuration:</strong> Review the network segmentation and VLAN settings to ensure they are properly configured and not causing connectivity issues.</li>
            <li><strong>Firmware Downgrade:</strong> In cases where a recent firmware update caused the issue, consider downgrading to a previous stable version.</li>
        </ul>
