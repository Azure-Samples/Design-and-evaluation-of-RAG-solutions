    <h1>Wireless Spectrum Usage</h1>
    <p>At QuickConnect, understanding the wireless spectrum is essential for ensuring efficient and effective telecommunications services. This document aims to provide a comprehensive guide on wireless spectrum usage, supporting our customer service agents as they assist customers with their inquiries.</p>

    <h2>What is Wireless Spectrum?</h2>
    <p>Wireless spectrum refers to the range of electromagnetic frequencies used in the transmission of sound, data, and video across wireless communication systems, such as mobile phones, Wi-Fi, and satellite communications. The spectrum ranges from very low frequencies (30 Hz) to extremely high frequencies (300 GHz).</p>

    <div class="info">
        <h3>Key Fact</h3>
        <p>The wireless spectrum is regulated by government agencies. In the United States, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) manages spectrum allocation.</p>
    </div>

    <h2>Divisions of the Wireless Spectrum</h2>
    <p>The wireless spectrum is divided into various bands, each with specific properties and suitable uses. The following table provides a detailed breakdown of these bands:</p>

    <h2>Spectrum Allocation and Usage</h2>
    <p>The allocation of spectrum involves assigning specific frequency bands for particular uses to avoid interference between different technologies and services. In the context of telecommunications, spectrum is allocated for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Mobile telephony:</strong> 2G, 3G, 4G, and emerging 5G networks.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless LAN (Wi-Fi):</strong> Uses both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.</li>
        <li><strong>Satellite communications:</strong> Typically in the SHF and EHF ranges.</li>
        <li><strong>Broadcasting:</strong> Radio and television in the VHF and UHF ranges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Why Regulation is Important</h3>
    <p>Effective spectrum management is vital for ensuring reliable communication services without harmful interference. Regulatory bodies, such as the FCC, oversee spectrum allocation, licensing, and enforcement.</p>

    <h2>Emerging Technologies and Spectrum Efficiency</h2>
    <p>Emerging technologies increasingly demand more bandwidth and efficient spectrum usage. Key trends include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>5G Networks:</strong> Offering higher speeds and lower latency, necessitating new spectrum allocations.</li>
        <li><strong>Internet of Things (IoT):</strong> Connecting numerous devices, demanding efficient and widespread spectrum use.</li>
        <li><strong>Spectrum Sharing:</strong> Techniques allowing multiple users to access the same frequency bands without interference.</li>
