    <li>Access our coverage map tool or internal database.</li>
    <li>Input the customer's details to see if fixed wireless internet is offered at their location.</li>
    <li>Inform the customer of the result and, if available, discuss plan options.</li>
</ol>

<h3>3. What are the typical speeds and data caps for Fixed Wireless Internet?</h3>
<p>Speeds can vary based on the service plan and the customer’s location relative to the transmitter. Our most common plans include:</p>

<h2>Installation Process</h2>
<p>The installation process for fixed wireless internet is streamlined to ensure minimal disruption. Here’s a step-by-step guide:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>Site Survey:</strong> A preliminary site survey is conducted to determine the best placement for the antenna and ensure an unobstructed line of sight to the transmitter.</li>
    <li><strong>Scheduling Installation:</strong> Once the site survey is completed, an installation appointment is scheduled at the customer’s convenience.</li>
    <li><strong>Installing Equipment:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>The technician installs the antenna on a fixed structure such as a rooftop or exterior wall.</li>
            <li>A modem is connected to the antenna via a coaxial or Ethernet cable.</li>
            <li>The modem is then connected to the customer’s devices, either directly or via a wireless router.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>Testing and Activation:</strong> The technician performs tests to ensure optimal signal strength and activates the service. The customer is given a demonstration of the system’s functionalities.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
<p>Here are some common issues customers might experience with fixed wireless internet and steps to troubleshoot:</p>

<h3>1. Signal Interference</h3>
<p>Interference can be caused by physical obstacles like buildings or trees, or other wireless devices. To troubleshoot:</p>
