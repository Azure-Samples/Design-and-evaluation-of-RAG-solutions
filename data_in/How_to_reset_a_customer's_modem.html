        <h2>Pre-Check Before Resetting the Modem</h2>
        <p>Before resetting the customer's modem, follow these steps to ensure that a reset is necessary:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <strong>Confirm Connectivity Issues:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask the customer about the specific issues they are experiencing (e.g., slow speeds, no connection, frequent disconnections).</li>
                    <li>Verify if other devices are experiencing the same issue.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Check for Service Outages:</strong>

            <li>
                <strong>Inspect Modem and Connections:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ask the customer to inspect the modem for any physical damage or loose connections.</li>
                    <li>Instruct the customer to ensure that all cables are securely connected.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If the issue persists after completing the above steps, proceed with the reset process.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="soft-reset">
        <h2>Performing a Soft Reset</h2>
        <p>A soft reset is a simple reboot of the modem and can often resolve minor connectivity issues without erasing any settings or configurations.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Instruct the customer to locate the power cable of the modem.</li>
            <li>Ask the customer to unplug the power cable from the modem.</li>
            <li>Advise the customer to wait for approximately 30 seconds.</li>
            <li>Instruct the customer to plug the power cable back into the modem.</li>
            <li>Ask the customer to wait for the modem lights to stabilize, which may take 2-5 minutes.</li>
        </ol>

    <section id="hard-reset">
        <h2>Performing a Hard Reset</h2>
        <p>A hard reset will restore the modem to its factory default settings. This process will erase any customized settings, including Wi-Fi network names and passwords.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ask the customer to locate the reset button on the modem. It is usually a small, recessed button labeled 'Reset.' A pen or paperclip may be needed to press it.</li>
            <li>Instruct the customer to press and hold the reset button for at least 10-15 seconds using a pen or paperclip.</li>
            <li>Advise the customer to release the button and wait for the modem to reboot. This process may take several minutes.</li>
            <li>Once the modem has rebooted, ask the customer to check the status lights as outlined in the table above.</li>
            <li>Guide the customer to reconnect their devices to the modem’s Wi-Fi network. Inform them that they may need to use the default Wi-Fi name (SSID) and password provided on the modem’s label.</li>
        </ol>
