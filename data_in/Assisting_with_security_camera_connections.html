        </ul>

        <h3>Basic Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>Before diving into complex solutions, it is crucial to go through some basic troubleshooting steps. Following these simple steps can often resolve the most common issues:</p>
        <ul class="steps">
            <li>Ensure the camera and router are properly powered and turned on.</li>
            <li>Verify that all cables are securely connected.</li>
            <li>Restart the camera and router.</li>
            <li>Check for any firmware updates for the camera and apply them if available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Connecting Wired Cameras</h3>
        <p>Wired cameras need a physical connection to the network. Here are the steps to assist customers with wired camera connections:</p>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li><span class="bold">Identify Ports:</span> Ensure that the camera is connected to the correct port on the router or network switch using an Ethernet cable.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Verify Connections:</span> Check that the Ethernet cable is securely connected to both the camera and the router/switch.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Network Configuration:</span> Access the camera's network settings through the provided software or web portal. Ensure that the camera is set to an appropriate IP address within the same subnet as the router.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Test Connection:</span> Use a computer connected to the same network to test the camera’s feed. Open a browser and enter the camera’s IP address to access the live feed.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Connecting Wireless Cameras</h3>
        <p>Wireless cameras offer greater flexibility but come with their own set of challenges. Follow these steps to connect wireless cameras:</p>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li><span class="bold">Place Camera:</span> Position the camera within the Wi-Fi range of the router.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Setup Mode:</span> Use the camera’s setup mode to connect it to the Wi-Fi network. This often involves holding a setup button for a few seconds.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Connect to Wi-Fi:</span> Using the camera’s app or setup wizard, select the desired Wi-Fi network and enter the password.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Test Feed:</span> Open the app or web portal and ensure that the camera’s live feed is available and stable.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Network Settings and Configuration</h3>
        <p>Correct network settings are crucial for seamless camera operation. Here are some fundamental settings to check:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="bold">IP Address:</span> Ensure that the camera has a static IP address to avoid it changing after a router reboot.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Subnet Mask:</span> Verify that the camera’s subnet mask matches that of the network it is connecting to.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">DHCP Reservations:</span> If using DHCP, ensure that the camera has a DHCP reservation to always receive the same IP address.</li>
            <li><span class="bold">Port Forwarding:</span> If the camera needs to be accessed externally, set up port forwarding on the router for the camera's IP address and port.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Common Issues and Solutions</h3>
        <p>Below is a table summarizing common issues customers may face and their respective solutions:</p>
        <table>
