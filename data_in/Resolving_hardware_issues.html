        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h2>Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
    <p>For each common issue, follow these step-by-step troubleshooting methods. Ensure you ask the customer detailed questions about the problem they are facing and follow the process systematically.</p>
    
    <h3>No Power</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Verify that the device is properly plugged into a power source.</li>
        <li>Check for any visible signs of damage to the power cord or outlet.</li>
        <li>Suggest trying a different power outlet or using a different power cord if available.</li>
        <li>Ask the customer to hold the power button for 15-30 seconds to perform a soft reset.</li>
        <li>Instruct the customer to remove and then replace the battery (if applicable).</li>
        <li>If the device still does not power on, recommend professional service or replacement based on warranty status.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Connection Drops</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Confirm that the customer is in an area with good network coverage.</li>
        <li>Ask the customer to restart both the device and the router/modem.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the device's firmware and software are up-to-date.</li>
        <li>Instruct the customer to reset network settings or forget and reconnect to the network.</li>
        <li>Check if other devices are experiencing the same issue to rule out network-wide problems.</li>
        <li>Recommend trying a wired connection if possible to determine if the problem is with the Wi-Fi module.</li>
        <li>If the problem persists, arrange for a device inspection or replacement.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Slow Performance</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Check for available storage space on the device; low storage can cause slowness.</li>
        <li>Instruct the customer to close unused applications running in the background.</li>
        <li>Perform a soft reset by powering off the device and then turning it back on.</li>
        <li>Ask if the customer has installed any new applications or updates recently that might be causing the problem.</li>
        <li>Recommend uninstalling any unnecessary or problematic apps.</li>
        <li>Consider suggesting a factory reset as a last resort, but make sure the customer backs up their data first.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Overheating</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask the customer to turn off the device and let it cool down for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Verify that the device is not being used in extreme temperatures or direct sunlight.</li>
        <li>Instruct the customer to remove any external covers or cases that might be trapping heat.</li>
        <li>Advise not to use the device while charging to reduce heat generation.</li>
        <li>Check if there are any apps running that are consuming excessive CPU resources and suggest closing them.</li>
        <li>If the device continues to overheat, recommend professional servicing or inspection.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Advanced Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>For more complex cases that the basic troubleshooting steps cannot resolve, follow advanced troubleshooting procedures.</p>
    
    <h3>Using Diagnostic Tools</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Leverage built-in diagnostic tools available in the device's firmware or software to identify specific hardware issues.</li>
        <li>Guide the customer on how to access and run these diagnostic tests.</li>
        <li>Interpret the results to determine the next steps.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Checking Hardware Connections</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Instruct the customer to check for loose or disconnected internal components if they are comfortable doing so.</li>
        <li>For PC-based devices, guide them to safely open the device and check the connections of RAM, hard drives, and other internal parts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Firmware Updates</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure that the device is running the latest firmware version to fix potential bugs and improve performance.</li>
        <li>Guide the customer through the firmware update process if they haven't already done so.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Dealing with Irate Customers</h2>
    <p>Handling customers who are frustrated due to hardware issues requires empathy, patience, and effective communication. Follow these best practices:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Remain Calm:</strong> Keep your composure and listen attentively to the customer's concerns without interruption.</li>
        <li><strong>Express Empathy:</strong> Acknowledge their frustration and assure them that you are there to help resolve the issue.</li>
        <li><strong>Simplify the Process:</strong> Avoid technical jargon and explain the troubleshooting steps in simple, easy-to-understand language.</li>
        <li><strong>Set Realistic Expectations:</strong> Make no promises that you cannot keep. Be realistic about the timelines for resolving hardware issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Offer Alternatives:</strong> If the troubleshooting process is lengthy, offer them options such as a callback or a follow-up email.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Escalation Procedures</h2>
    <p>When basic and advanced troubleshooting methods fail to resolve the hardware issue, escalate the case to higher technical support or the appropriate department:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Document all the steps taken during the initial troubleshooting process, including any diagnostic results.</li>
        <li>Provide a detailed description of the issue in the escalation report.</li>
        <li>Inform the customer of the escalation and give them an estimated time frame for a resolution.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the escalation is tagged with the correct priority level based on the nature of the issue and the customer's subscription plan.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Repair and Replacement Policies</h2>
    <p>Understand QuickConnect's policies regarding the repair and replacement of hardware devices to provide accurate information to the customers:</p>
