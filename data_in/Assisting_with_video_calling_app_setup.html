        <h2 id="step-by-step-guide">Step-by-Step Guide</h2>
        <h3>Installing the App</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Instruct the customer to visit their respective app store (Google Play Store for Android, App Store for iOS).</li>
            <li>Search for the video calling app (e.g., Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype).</li>
            <li>Tap the "Install" or "Get" button to begin the download.</li>
            <li>Once downloaded, the app will automatically install. This may take a few moments.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Account Setup</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open the installed app.</li>
            <li>Select "Sign Up" to create a new account or "Log In" if the customer already has an account.</li>
            <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to enter personal information (name, email, password).</li>
            <li>Verify the email address if prompted (check the inbox for a verification email and click the provided link).</li>
            <li>Once verified, proceed to log in with the new credentials.</li>
        </ol>

        <div class="note">
            <p><strong>Note:</strong> Make sure the customer keeps their login details secure and recommends using a strong, unique password for their account.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Adjusting Settings</h3>
        <p>Once the app is installed and the account is set up, make sure the customer adjusts their settings for the best experience:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Audio Settings:</strong> Check and adjust microphone and speaker settings. Ensure that the correct devices are selected, especially if using external hardware like headphones or a USB microphone.</li>
            <li><strong>Video Settings:</strong> Ensure the camera is working correctly and that the correct device is selected. Adjust video quality settings if necessary for bandwidth considerations.</li>
            <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Adjust notification settings according to the customer's preferences so that they are alerted to incoming calls and messages.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>Why can't I hear or see the other person?</h3>
        <p>This is typically due to issues with audio/video settings or the device's hardware. Ensure the customer has allowed the app to access the microphone and camera. Check the device settings and the app settings to confirm the correct hardware is selected.</p>
        
        <h3>What should I do if the video call is constantly dropping?</h3>
        <p>Frequent disconnections can be due to poor network connectivity. Advise the customer to move closer to their Wi-Fi router, reset their internet connection, or use a wired connection if possible. Ensure that other devices on the network are not consuming excessive bandwidth during the call.</p>
        
        <h3>How do I invite someone to a video call?</h3>
        <p>Most video calling apps have an "Invite" or "Share" option. Guide the customer to this feature and have them enter the email address or send a link to the person they wish to invite. For scheduled calls, help them navigate the scheduling feature to set up future calls and send calendar invites.</p>
        
        <h3>Why is my screen share feature not working?</h3>
        <p>Screen sharing may be blocked by device permissions. Ensure the customer has enabled screen share permissions in their device settings. Also, it can sometimes be restricted by the operating system or additional security software.</p>
