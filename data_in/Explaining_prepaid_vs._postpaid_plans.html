    <h1>QuickConnect Customer Service Guide</h1>
    <h2>Understanding Prepaid vs. Postpaid Plans</h2>
    
    <p>Welcome to the QuickConnect customer service guide. This document is intended to assist you, our customer service agents, in explaining the differences between prepaid and postpaid plans to our valued customers. Understanding these options will help you provide clear and accurate information, ensuring customer satisfaction.</p>

    <h3>1. Definitions</h3>
    <p>
        <strong>Prepaid Plans:</strong> Prepaid plans require customers to pay for their service upfront, before they can use it. This typically involves purchasing a set amount of usage or a specific time period.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Postpaid Plans:</strong> Postpaid plans allow customers to use the service first and pay for it later. Usually, the billing cycle is monthly, and the customer receives a bill at the end of the period based on the usage.
    </p>
