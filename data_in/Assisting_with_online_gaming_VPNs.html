        <h2>1. Introduction to VPNs in Online Gaming</h2>
        <p>VPN, or Virtual Private Network, is a service that encrypts a user's internet connection and provides a secure, private network over a public internet connection. In the context of online gaming, VPNs help players to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Access region-restricted games and servers.</li>
            <li>Reduce latency by connecting to a server closer to the game server.</li>
            <li>Enhance privacy and security by masking their IP address.</li>
            <li>Prevent DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) attacks.</li>
        </ul>
