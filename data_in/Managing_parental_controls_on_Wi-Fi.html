    <main>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the QuickConnect Customer Support Guide on managing parental controls on Wi-Fi. This document will provide step-by-step instructions, tips, and troubleshooting advice to help you assist customers in setting up and maintaining parental controls on their Wi-Fi networks. Parental controls are crucial for families to ensure a safe online environment for their children by restricting access to inappropriate content and managing online time.</p>
        
        <h2>Overview of Parental Controls</h2>
        <p>Parental controls allow users to manage and restrict the online activities of other users on their network. These controls can be configured to set daily limits on internet usage, block inappropriate websites, and monitor internet access in real time. Here are some common features of Wi-Fi parental controls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Website Blocking</li>
            <li>Time Limits</li>
            <li>Usage Monitoring</li>
            <li>Access Scheduling</li>
            <li>Content Filtering</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Steps to Set Up Parental Controls</h2>
        <h3>1. Accessing the Router's Admin Interface</h3>
        <p>To set up parental controls, the customer needs to log in to their router's admin interface. This is usually done through a web browser by entering the router's IP address (typically <code>192.168.0.1</code> or <code>192.168.1.1</code>) in the address bar. Here are the steps:</p>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Step</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>Open a web browser on a device connected to the Wi-Fi network.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>2</td>
                <td>Enter the router's IP address in the address bar and press Enter.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Log in with the router's admin username and password (default credentials are often 'admin' for both, but customers should check their router manual).</td>
            </tr>
        </table>
        
        <h3>2. Navigating to the Parental Controls Section</h3>
        <p>After logging in, find the 'Parental Controls' section. This may be located under different menu names depending on the router brand (such as 'Security', 'Advanced Settings', or 'Access Control'). Here are general steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Look for the 'Parental Controls' option within the main menu or under the advanced settings section.</li>
            <li>Click on 'Parental Controls' to open the configuration interface.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Configuring Parental Controls</h3>
        <p>Once in the parental controls section, customers can set up various controls. Here are examples of common configurations:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Website Blocking:</strong> Add specific URLs or keywords to block certain websites.</li>
            <li><strong>Time Limits:</strong> Set limits on the amount of time specific devices can use the internet each day.</li>
            <li><strong>Access Scheduling:</strong> Specify time periods during which internet access is allowed or denied.</li>
            <li><strong>Content Filtering:</strong> Choose predetermined categories to automatically block types of content (such as adult content, gaming, or social media).</li>
        </ul>

        </div>
        
        <h3>1. Regularly Update Router Firmware</h3>
        <p>Encourage customers to keep their router's firmware up to date to ensure they have the latest security features and parental control updates. Here are some tips:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check for firmware updates in the router's admin interface.</li>
            <li>Set the router to update automatically if this option is available.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Use Strong Passwords</h3>
        <p>Advise customers to use strong, unique passwords for both their Wi-Fi network and the router admin interface. Tips for creating strong passwords include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Use a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.</li>
            <li>Avoid using easily guessable information, such as names or birthdays.</li>
            <li>Regularly change passwords and avoid reusing past passwords.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>3. Utilize Built-in Apps and Tools</h3>
        <p>Many modern routers come with companion apps for smartphones that make managing parental controls easier. Suggest customers to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Download and install the router's official app from a trusted app store.</li>
            <li>Use the app to set up and manage parental controls conveniently from their mobile device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
        <h3>1. Forgotten Router Login Credentials</h3>
        <p>If a customer can't log in to their router, they can try the following solutions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check the default login credentials in the router's manual or on a sticker on the router itself.</li>
            <li>Reset the router to factory settings (note this will erase all custom settings).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Parental Controls Not Working</h3>
        <p>If parental controls are not functioning as expected, advise the following checks:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the firmware is up to date.</li>
            <li>Verify that the parental controls are correctly configured and applied to the correct devices.</li>
            <li>Restart the router to apply any new settings.</li>
        </ul>
