        <h2 id="intro">Introduction to Guest Networks</h2>
        <p>A guest network is a separate, isolated section of a main network designed to provide internet access to visitors without giving them access to the primary network's resources. Configuring a guest network ensures the main network's security while providing a convenient connection for guests.</p>

        <h3>Benefits of Using a Guest Network</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Enhanced Security:</strong> Isolates guest devices from the main network.</li>
            <li><strong>Controlled Access:</strong> Limits the bandwidth and access duration for guests.</li>
            <li><strong>Simplified Management:</strong> Easily monitor guest usage and apply restrictions.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="setup">Setting Up a Guest Network</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to set up a guest network on your router:</p>

        <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Access Router Settings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Open a web browser and enter your router's IP address (e.g., <code>192.168.1.1</code>).</li>
                    <li>Log in with the router's admin username and password.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Navigate to Guest Network Settings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Look for a menu like <i>Wireless Settings</i> or <i>Guest Network</i>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Enable Guest Network:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Find the option to enable the guest network and switch it on.</li>
                    <li>Set a unique SSID (network name) for your guest network.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Configure Security Settings:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Choose a security mode, typically <code>WPA2</code> or <code>WPA3</code>.</li>
                    <li>Set a strong password for the guest network.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Set Bandwidth Limits (Optional):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>If your router supports it, set bandwidth limits to control the amount of data your guests can use.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Save Changes:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>Ensure all your changes are saved. The router may reboot to apply new settings.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2 id="security">Maintaining Security</h2>
        <p>Security is paramount when setting up a guest network. Follow these best practices to maintain optimal security:</p>

        <h3>Best Practices for Guest Network Security</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Strong Encryption:</strong> Always use the latest security standards like <code>WPA3</code> if available.</li>
            <li><strong>Regularly Change Passwords:</strong> Change the guest network password periodically to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
            <li><strong>Monitor Network Activity:</strong> Monitor the devices connected to the guest network to identify any suspicious activity.</li>
            <li><strong>Firmware Updates:</strong> Regularly update your router's firmware to protect against vulnerabilities.</li>
            <li><strong>Disable Administrative Access:</strong> Ensure the guest network does not have administrative access to the router settings.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="troubleshoot">Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
        <p>If the customer encounters issues with their guest network, the following troubleshooting steps may help:</p>

        <h3>Common Issues and Solutions</h3>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Issue</th>

                    <td>Guests unable to connect</td>
                    <td>Ensure the guest network is enabled and the SSID is broadcasting. Verify the password being used is correct.</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Slow network speeds</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>Insecure connections</td>
                    <td>Verify that appropriate security settings (e.g., WPA2/WPA3) are in place and the password is strong.</td>

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
        <h3>1. How many devices can connect to the guest network simultaneously?</h3>
        <p>The number of devices that can connect to the guest network depends on the router's capabilities. Most modern routers can handle at least 20-30 devices.</p>

        <h3>2. Can I customize the login page for my guest network?</h3>
        <p>Some routers offer the option to create a captive portal, which allows for a custom login page. Refer to the router's user manual for specific instructions.</p>

        <h3>3. Can guests access other devices on the guest network?</h3>
        <p>By default, guest networks isolate devices from each other. This helps prevent potential security risks and maintains privacy.</p>

        <h3>4. How do I disable the guest network?</h3>
        <p>To disable the guest network, log in to your router settings, navigate to the guest network configuration page, and switch off the guest network option.</p>

        <h3>5. Why should I use different SSIDs for the main and guest networks?</h3>
        <p>Using different SSIDs helps distinguish the main network from the guest network, making it easier to manage and ensuring guests connect to the appropriate network.</p>
