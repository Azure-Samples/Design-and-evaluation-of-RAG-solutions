        <h2>Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
        <p><strong>Step 1: Check the Smart TV</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure the Wi-Fi on the smart TV is turned on.</li>
            <li>Verify that the smart TV is within range of the router.</li>
            <li>Reboot the smart TV by turning it off and unplugging it for a minute, then plugging it back in and turning it on.</li>
            <li>Ensure the TV's firmware is up to date.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Step 2: Check the Internet Connection</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Test the internet connection on another device (e.g., smartphone or laptop) to ensure the internet is working.</li>
            <li>Restart the router and modem.</li>
            <li>Ensure no other devices are consuming excessive bandwidth.</li>
            <li>Check for service outages in the area using QuickConnect's status webpage or app.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Step 3: Check the Wi-Fi Settings</strong></p>
        <ol>
            <li>Make sure the TV is connected to the correct SSID (network name).</li>
            <li>Verify the Wi-Fi password entered on the smart TV is correct.</li>
            <li>Reset the network settings on the smart TV and try reconnecting.</li>
        </ol>

        <p><strong>Step 4: Advanced Troubleshooting</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Change Wi-Fi Channel:</strong> Sometimes, interference from other networks can cause connection issues. Log into the router settings and change the Wi-Fi channel.</li>
            <li><strong>Factory Reset:</strong> As a last resort, perform a factory reset on the smart TV. Note that this will erase all customized settings and data.</li>
        </ul>
