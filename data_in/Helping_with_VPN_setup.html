        <h1>QuickConnect Customer Service Guide</h1>
        <h2>Helping with VPN Setup</h2>
        <p>As a customer service agent at QuickConnect, you may encounter customers who need assistance setting up a Virtual Private Network (VPN). This guide will help you provide clear, step-by-step instructions to ensure our customers can set up their VPN successfully.</p>

        <h3>What is a VPN?</h3>
        <p>A Virtual Private Network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure, encrypted connection over a less secure network, such as the internet. VPNs are commonly used to protect the privacy of internet users, secure sensitive data, and provide access to restricted or geo-blocked content.</p>

        <h3>Why Use a VPN?</h3>
        <p>Customers use VPNs for several reasons, including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Privacy:</strong> To keep their internet activities private and avoid tracking by ISPs, websites, and third parties.</li>
            <li><strong>Security:</strong> To protect sensitive information while using public Wi-Fi networks.</li>
            <li><strong>Access:</strong> To bypass geo-restrictions and access content or services unavailable in their region.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps to Set Up a VPN</h3>
        <p>The process for setting up a VPN can vary depending on the device and VPN service the customer is using. Below are general steps to guide customers through the setup on different platforms.</p>
        
        <h4>1. Choose a VPN Service</h4>
        <p>Customers need to select a VPN service provider. While we cannot endorse specific services, you can suggest they look for reputable providers known for security, speed, and customer support. Popular options include ExpressVPN, NordVPN, and CyberGhost.</p>
        
        <h4>2. Create an Account and Subscribe</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Visit the VPN provider’s website.</li>
            <li>Select a plan that suits their needs.</li>
            <li>Create an account by providing an email address and setting a password.</li>
            <li>Complete the payment process to subscribe to the service.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h4>3. Download and Install the VPN Application</h4>

        <table>

                <tr>
                    <th>Device</th>
                    <th>Instructions</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Windows/Mac</td>
                    <td>

                <tr>
                    <td>iOS/Android</td>
                    <td>

                            <li>Open the App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android).</li>

            </tbody>
        </table>

        <h4>4. Configure the VPN</h4>
        <h5>Login to the Application</h5>

        </ul>

        <h5>Enable Additional Features (Optional)</h5>

            <li>Open the application settings.</li>
