    <h1>Satellite Internet Troubleshooting Guide</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the QuickConnect Satellite Internet Troubleshooting Guide. This document is designed to assist customer service agents in providing effective support to customers experiencing issues with their satellite internet service. Ensure to follow the steps outlined here to diagnose and resolve common problems. Keep this guide handy for quick reference.</p>

    <h2>Understanding Satellite Internet</h2>
    <p>Satellite internet operates by transmitting data between a satellite dish at the customer's location and an orbiting satellite. It provides internet connectivity to remote and rural areas where traditional broadband services such as DSL or cable are not available. Below are some key components essential for satellite internet connectivity:</p>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Satellite Dish:</strong> Mounted outside the customer's premises, it receives and transmits signals to the satellite.</li>
        <li><strong>Modem:</strong> Connects the satellite dish to the customer's local network and devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Router:</strong> Distributes the internet connection wirelessly within the customer's premises.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Common Issues and Solutions</h2>
    <p>The following table summarizes common issues customers might face with their satellite internet service and the corresponding troubleshooting steps.</p>

    <h2>Detailed Troubleshooting Steps</h2>

    <h3>1. Checking Physical Connections</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        This is an essential initial step to rule out any issues caused by loose or disconnected cables.
    </div>
    <ul>
        <li>Instruct the customer to check that the power cables for both the modem and router are securely plugged in.</li>
        <li>Ask them to ensure that the coaxial cable connecting the satellite dish to the modem is firmly attached and not damaged.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Adjusting Router and Modem Settings</h3>
    <p>If the physical connections are intact, adjusting router and modem settings might solve the issue:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Log in to the modem's web interface using the provided IP address (refer to the modem's user manual).</li>
        <li>Check the signal strength and quality indicators, as weak signals may impact connectivity.</li>
        <li>Navigate to the router settings and review the wireless settings to ensure they are configured correctly.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Running Speed Tests</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        Running a speed test helps diagnose if the internet speed is within acceptable range.
    </div>
    <p>Guide the customer to perform the following steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Visit a reliable speed test website (e.g., speedtest.net).</li>
        <li>Instruct them to connect a device directly to the modem using an Ethernet cable for accurate results.</li>
        <li>Check both download and upload speeds and compare them against the subscribed plan.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>4. Weather and Environmental Factors</h3>
    <p>Satellite internet is susceptible to weather conditions and obstructions that might disrupt the signal. In these cases, the following should be considered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Advise the customer to check the local weather for storms, heavy rain, or snow which can interfere with the satellite signal.</li>
        <li>Instruct them to clear any obstacles such as tree branches or debris that might be blocking the satellite dish.</li>
        <li>If a realignment of the dish is required, guide them to follow the user manual or contact a professional for assistance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Modem and Router Restarts</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        Restarting the modem and router can often resolve temporary issues.
    </div>
    <p>Follow these instructions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Instruct the customer to power off the modem and router.</li>
        <li>Wait for at least 30 seconds before powering them back on.</li>
        <li>Once powered back on, wait for the modem's LED lights to stabilize before testing the internet connection again.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advanced Troubleshooting</h2>
    <p>In some instances, advanced troubleshooting might be required. If basic steps do not resolve the issue, consider the following advanced procedures:</p>

    <h3>Firmware Updates</h3>
    <p>Firmware updates for both the modem and router can sometimes address underlying issues.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Instruct the customer to visit the manufacturer's website for the latest firmware updates.</li>
        <li>Assist them in downloading and installing the updates if necessary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>Checking for Interference</h3>
    <div class="info-box">
        Electronic devices can sometimes interfere with the satellite signal.
    </div>
    <p>Conduct a thorough check for potential sources of interference:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Move the router away from other electronic devices such as cordless phones or microwaves.</li>
        <li>Ask the customer to identify and minimize the use of devices that might generate significant electromagnetic interference.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Contacting Technical Support</h3>
    <p>If all troubleshooting steps have been exhausted and the issue persists, escalate the problem to technical support:</p>
    <ul>
