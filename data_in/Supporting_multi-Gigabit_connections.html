        <h2>Troubleshooting Multi-Gigabit Connection Issues</h2>
        <h3>1. Slow Internet Speed</h3>
        <p>If the customer's speed test results are significantly below the expected rates, follow these steps:</p>
        <ul class="highlight">
            <li>Ensure the customer is using a wired connection for the speed test, as wireless connections can be affected by interference and signal loss.</li>
            <li>Check for any ongoing outages or maintenance work in the customer’s area.</li>
            <li>Confirm that no other devices on the network are consuming large amounts of bandwidth.</li>
            <li>Reset the modem and router, and wait for them to fully reboot.</li>
            <li>Advise the customer to update their router firmware to the latest version.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Incompatible Equipment</h3>
        <p>It's crucial to ensure that the customer's equipment is capable of supporting multi-Gigabit speeds. Please review the following guidelines:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Device</th>
                    <th>Requirement</th>
                    <th>Recommendation</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Modem</td>

        <h3>3. Wi-Fi Performance</h3>
        <p>Even with multi-Gigabit speeds available in a wired setup, Wi-Fi performance might not match due to various factors. Consider these points:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Router Placement:</strong> Place the router in a central location away from walls and other obstructions to maximize signal coverage.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Interference:</strong> Minimize interference by keeping the router away from other electronic devices and choosing a less congested Wi-Fi channel.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Wi-Fi Standards:</strong> Use the latest Wi-Fi standards (802.11ac or 802.11ax) which can handle higher speeds and better performance.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Advanced Troubleshooting Techniques</h3>
        <p>For recurring issues or more complex situations, these advanced steps might be necessary:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Network Analysis:</strong> Conduct a thorough network analysis using specialized software tools to detect any underlying issues that are not immediately obvious.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Signal Strength Testing:</strong> Use a Wi-Fi signal analyzer to check for weak spots in the network coverage and suggest solutions like additional access points or mesh networking systems.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Quality of Service (QoS) Settings:</strong> Configure QoS settings on the customer's router to prioritize critical applications and manage bandwidth distribution effectively.
            </li>
        </ul>
