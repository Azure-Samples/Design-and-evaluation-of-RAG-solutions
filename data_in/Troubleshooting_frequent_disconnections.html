        <h3 id="identify-issue">1. Identifying the Issue</h3>
        <p>To begin troubleshooting, first, you need to identify the core of the issue. Start by asking the customer the following questions:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>What device(s) are experiencing disconnections?</li>
            <li>What time of day do the disconnections occur?</li>
            <li>Is the issue happening on both wired and wireless connections?</li>
            <li>Have there been any recent changes in your network setup?</li>
            <li>Are you receiving any error messages?</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="initial-steps">2. Initial Troubleshooting Steps</h3>
        <p>The initial troubleshooting steps are basic yet essential procedures that can quickly resolve common issues:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure all cables are securely connected.</li>
            <li>Power cycle the modem and router:
                <ul>
                    <li>Turn off the modem and router.</li>
                    <li>Wait for 30 seconds.</li>
                    <li>Turn on the modem and wait for it to fully boot up.</li>
                    <li>Turn on the router and wait for it to fully boot up.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ask the customer to move closer to the router if they are using a wireless connection.</li>
            <li>Check for any firmware updates for the router and modem.</li>
            <li>Disable and re-enable the network connection on the affected device.</li>
            <li>Restart the affected device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="connection-type">3. Specific Troubleshooting Based on Connection Type</h3>
        <h4>Wired Connection</h4>
        <p>For customers experiencing issues with a wired connection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the Ethernet cable is not damaged.</li>
            <li>Try a different Ethernet cable.</li>
            <li>Ensure the Ethernet port on the device and router is not faulty – try a different port if available.</li>
            <li>Check for driver updates for the network adapter on the customer's device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Wireless Connection</h4>
        <p>For customers experiencing issues with a wireless connection:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Check for Wi-Fi signal interference:
                <ul>
                    <li>Move the router away from other electronic devices that could cause interference (such as microwaves, cordless phones, etc.).</li>
                    <li>Check for overlapping Wi-Fi channels and change the Wi-Fi channel on the router if necessary.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Ensure no strict connectivity settings or MAC address filtering are interfering.</li>
            <li>Forget the Wi-Fi network on the customer’s device and reconnect.</li>
            <li>Ask the customer to update their device's network drivers or operating system.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="advanced-troubleshooting">4. Advanced Troubleshooting</h3>
        <p>If the initial steps do not resolve the issue, you may need to perform more sophisticated troubleshooting:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Run a speed test and monitor latency and packet loss.
                <ul>
                    <li>Use tools such as ping, traceroute, and Network Analyzer to diagnose network latency and packet loss issues.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Check the modem or router logs for error messages or abnormal activity.</li>
            <li>Examine the network topology and ensure there are no loops or misconfigurations.</li>
            <li>Configure Quality of Service (QoS) settings on the router to prioritize essential traffic.</li>
            <li>Consider resetting the router and modem to factory settings and reconfiguring them from scratch.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="escalation">5. When to Escalate</h3>
        <p>If you have followed all the troubleshooting steps and customers are still experiencing frequent disconnections, it is essential to escalate the issue to a higher-level technician or support team:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collect all relevant information including:
                <ul>
                    <li>Customer details and account information.</li>
                    <li>Summary of the issue and steps already taken.</li>
                    <li>Logs and diagnostic data collected during troubleshooting.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Document any patterns or anomalies observed.</li>
            <li>Inform the customer of the escalation and provide an estimated response time.</li>
            <li>Follow up to ensure the customer has been contacted and the issue has been resolved.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 id="preventive-measures">6. Preventive Measures</h3>
        <p>To help customers avoid frequent disconnections in the future, suggest the following preventative measures:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Regularly update the firmware of modems, routers, and network devices.</li>
            <li>Conduct periodic checks for loose cables and hardware malfunctions.</li>
            <li>Ensure the network environment is clear of potential interference sources.</li>
            <li>Educate customers on optimal router placement and Wi-Fi channel settings.</li>
