            <h2>Overview of Ethernet</h2>
            <p>Ethernet is a technology that uses cables to connect devices to a local area network (LAN) for high-speed communication. It is one of the most common methods of connecting computers, routers, and switches within a network.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of Ethernet</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Stable Connection:</strong> Ethernet provides a reliable and stable connection, reducing the likelihood of interference and signal loss.</li>
                <li><strong>Faster Speeds:</strong> Ethernet often offers faster data transfer speeds compared to Wi-Fi, especially over long distances.</li>
                <li><strong>Lower Latency:</strong> Ethernet connections typically have lower latency, which is crucial for activities like online gaming and video conferencing.</li>
                <li><strong>Security:</strong> Ethernet is generally more secure than Wi-Fi since it requires physical access to the cable for data interception.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Disadvantages of Ethernet</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Limited Mobility:</strong> Devices need to be physically connected to the network, which limits mobility and flexibility.</li>
                <li><strong>Installation:</strong> Setting up Ethernet can be labor-intensive, requiring cable management and installation, especially in larger spaces.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Overview of Wi-Fi</h2>
            <p>Wi-Fi is a wireless networking technology that uses radio waves to provide high-speed internet and network connections to devices within its coverage area.</p>
            <h3>Advantages of Wi-Fi</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Mobility:</strong> Wi-Fi allows users to connect to the network from anywhere within the signal range, providing greater mobility and convenience.</li>
                <li><strong>Simpler Installation:</strong> Wi-Fi eliminates the need for physical cables, making the initial setup easier and less intrusive.</li>
                <li><strong>Multiple Device Support:</strong> Wi-Fi can support multiple devices simultaneously without the need for additional cabling.</li>
                <li><strong>Expandability:</strong> Wi-Fi networks can be easily expanded with additional access points to increase coverage.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Disadvantages of Wi-Fi</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Potential Interference:</strong> Wi-Fi signals can be affected by physical obstructions like walls and electronic interference from other devices.</li>
                <li><strong>Variable Speeds:</strong> Wi-Fi speeds can fluctuate based on distance from the router, network congestion, and signal interference.</li>
                <li><strong>Security Risks:</strong> Wi-Fi networks can be more vulnerable to security breaches if not properly secured with encryption and strong passwords.</li>
                <li><strong>Latency Issues:</strong> Wi-Fi connections may have higher latency compared to Ethernet, impacting activities that require real-time communication.</li>

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
            <h3>1. Which is faster, Ethernet or Wi-Fi?</h3>
            <p>Generally, Ethernet is faster than Wi-Fi due to its direct wired connection, which often provides higher and more consistent speeds.</p>
            
            <h3>2. Can I use both Ethernet and Wi-Fi on the same device?</h3>
            <p>Yes, many devices are capable of using both Ethernet and Wi-Fi connections simultaneously or switching between them as needed. However, the device will typically prioritize one connection over the other based on the configuration.</p>
            
            <h3>3. Is Wi-Fi less secure than Ethernet?</h3>
            <p>Wi-Fi can be less secure than Ethernet because it is susceptible to remote attacks and unauthorized access if not properly
