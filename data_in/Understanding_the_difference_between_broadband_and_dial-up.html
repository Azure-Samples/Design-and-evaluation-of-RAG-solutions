        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>As a customer service agent at QuickConnect, it is essential to understand the primary differences between broadband and dial-up internet connections. This knowledge will enable you to provide accurate information and effective support to our customers. In this document, we will explore the key differences, advantages, and disadvantages of both types of internet connections.</p>

        <h2>Key Differences</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Category</th>
                <th>Broadband</th>

            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Definition</td>
                <td>Broadband is a high-speed internet connection that is always on and faster than traditional dial-up access.</td>
                <td>Dial-up is an internet connection that uses a standard telephone line to connect to the internet.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Speed</td>
                <td>Broadband speeds typically range from several Mbps (Megabits per second) up to 1 Gbps (Gigabit per second).</td>
                <td>Dial-up speeds are generally limited to 56 kbps (Kilobits per second).</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Connection Type</td>
                <td>Broadband can use various types of connections, including DSL, Cable, Fiber-optic, and Satellite.</td>
                <td>Dial-up uses a standard telephone line and a modem to establish a connection.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Always-On Connection</td>
                <td>Broadband provides an always-on connection, meaning users do not need to reconnect every time they want to access the internet.</td>
                <td>Dial-up requires users to dial a number and establish a connection each time they want to access the internet.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Telephone Line Usage</td>
                <td>Broadband does not interfere with the use of the telephone line for voice calls.</td>
                <td>Dial-up uses the telephone line, making it unavailable for voice calls while connected to the internet.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Cost</td>
                <td>Broadband can be more expensive due to higher speeds and reliability.</td>
                <td>Dial-up is generally cheaper but comes with significantly lower speeds and less reliability.</td>
            </tr>

            <li><strong>Customer Complains About Slow Internet Speeds</strong></li>
            <p>Determine if the customer is using a dial-up connection. If so, explain the speed limitations of dial-up and suggest upgrading to a broadband plan for faster internet speeds.</p>

            <li><strong>Customer Needs to Use the Internet and Phone Simultaneously</strong></li>
            <p>If the customer is using dial-up, inform them that they will need to switch to a broadband connection to use the internet and phone simultaneously without interruption.</p>

            <li><strong>Customer Is Concerned About Cost</strong></li>
