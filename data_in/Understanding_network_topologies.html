        <h2>Detailed Explanation of Common Topologies</h2>
        
        <h3>1. Bus Topology</h3>
        <p>In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable, known as the bus. Here, data travels along the bus and is received by all devices. Despite its simplicity and cost-effectiveness for small networks, a major downside is that any fault in the central cable results in network failure. Bus topology is commonly used in small workgroup or LAN environments.</p>
        
        <h3>2. Star Topology</h3>
        <p>The star topology features a central hub or switch to which all network devices are connected. This design makes it easy to add new devices and diagnose problems. Its main weakness lies in its reliance on the central hub; if the hub fails, the entire network is affected. Star topology is widely used in both home and commercial networks due to its simplicity and relatively low installation costs, despite being cable-intensive.</p>
        
        <h3>3. Ring Topology</h3>
        <p>Devices in a ring topology are connected in a circular fashion, where each device has two neighbors. Data travels in one or both directions depending on the ring configuration, minimizing collisions. However, a break in the ring can halt data transmission throughout the network. Ring topology is commonly used in high-traffic environments where consistent performance is essential.</p>
        
        <h3>4. Mesh Topology</h3>
        <p>Mesh topology establishes multiple connections between devices, ensuring high redundancy and reliability. There are two types of mesh topologies: full mesh, where each node connects to every other node, and partial mesh, where nodes are selectively interconnected. Mesh networks are highly fault-tolerant but can be expensive and challenging to install and maintain, making them suitable for mission-critical applications.</p>
        
        <h3>5. Hybrid Topology</h3>
        <p>A hybrid topology incorporates elements of various topologies to leverage their strengths while mitigating weaknesses. For example, combining star and bus topologies can enhance fault tolerance and scalability. Hybrid topologies are versatile and scalable but demand more intricate designs and higher implementation costs. This makes them ideal for large-scale enterprises and dynamic network environments.</p>
