            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr class="highlight">
                <td>Video Streaming (SD)</td>
                <td>3-4 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Video Streaming (HD)</td>
                <td>5-8 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="highlight">
                <td>Video Streaming (4K)</td>
                <td>25 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>General Browsing and Emails</td>
                <td>1-5 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
            <tr class="highlight">
                <td>Online Learning Platforms</td>
                <td>5-10 Mbps</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>

    <h3>2. Check Customer's Network Setup</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ask the customer to restart their modem and router.</li>
        <li>Ensure the router is placed in a central location for optimal coverage.</li>
        <li>Check for interference from other electronic devices.</li>
        <li>Instruct the customer to use a wired connection (Ethernet) if possible, for more stable connectivity.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Device Optimization</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure the customer's device (laptop, tablet, etc.) has the latest software updates.</li>
        <li>Close unnecessary applications and browser tabs that might be consuming bandwidth.</li>
        <li>Recommend using a modern browser such as Chrome or Firefox for better compatibility with e-learning platforms.</li>
        <li>Check the device for malware or viruses using a reliable antivirus program.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Advanced Troubleshooting Techniques</h2>
    <h3>1. Network Analyzer Tools</h3>
    <p>Use network analyzer tools to assess the quality of the internet connection. Tools such as:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.speedtest.net/" target="_blank">Speedtest.net</a> for measuring internet speed.</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.pingtest.net/" target="_blank">Pingtest.net</a> for assessing packet loss and latency.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Router Configuration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Log into the router's settings page.</li>
        <li>Ensure the firmware is up-to-date.</li>
        <li>Adjust Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize e-learning traffic.</li>
        <li>Check for any MAC address filtering or parental control settings that might be blocking access to educational websites.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. DNS Configuration</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Recommend using reliable DNS servers such as Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4) or Cloudflare DNS (1.1.1.1).</li>
        <li>Guide the customer on how to change their DNS settings on their device or router.</li>
    </ul>
