    <h2>Resolving Service Interruptions</h2>
    
    <p>Service interruptions are one of the most common issues faced by customers using telecommunications services. This guide provides comprehensive steps and best practices to aid QuickConnect customer service agents in resolving these issues efficiently and effectively.</p>
    
    <h3>1. Initial Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Listen to the Customer's Issue:</strong> Gather detailed information about the service interruption, including duration, frequency, and any error messages received.</li>
        <li><strong>Verify Account Information:</strong> Confirm the customer's account details to ensure the problem is connected to their account and not a general outage.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>2. Check for Outages</h3>
    <p>Before diving into detailed troubleshooting, verify if the service interruption is due to a scheduled maintenance or an unplanned outage in the customer's area.</p>

    <h3>4. Detailed Troubleshooting Steps</h3>
    <p>When the issue is not immediately obvious, follow these detailed troubleshooting steps:</p>
    
    <h4>4.1. Verify Connectivity</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wired Connection:</strong> Ask the customer to check if they're using Ethernet cables and if they are securely connected to their devices.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Connection:</strong> Ensure the Wi-Fi network is visible and that the customer is connected to the correct network with a strong signal.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>4.2. Restart Equipment</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask the customer to power off their modem/router and any connected devices (e.g., computers, Smart TVs).</li>
        <li>Wait for about 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>Power the modem/router back on and wait until all lights are stable.</li>
        <li>Turn on the connected devices and check if the issue persists.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h4>4.3. Check Device Settings</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Guide the customer to check their device's network settings to ensure there are no misconfigurations.</li>
        <li>For advanced users, advise them to check DHCP settings and ensure there are no IP conflicts.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>4.4. Conduct Speed Test</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Direct the customer to a reputable speed test website (e.g., speedtest.net).</li>
        <li>Compare the results with their subscribed service plan speeds.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If the speeds are significantly lower than expected, further investigation into network performance is needed.</p>
    
    <h3>5. Advanced Troubleshooting</h3>
    <p>In cases where initial troubleshooting does not resolve the issue, proceed with advanced troubleshooting:</p>
    
    <h4>5.1. Modem/Router Log Analysis</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>Connection drops or timeouts</li>
        <li>Firmware updates</li>
        <li>Signal strength fluctuations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>5.2. Contact Technical Support</h4>
    <p>If the issue is beyond basic and advanced customer-side troubleshooting, escalate the ticket to Technical Support. Provide them with the following details:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Customer's account information</li>
        <li>Detailed description of the issue</li>
        <li>Steps already taken</li>
        <li>Any logs or error messages collected</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>6. Follow-Up Actions</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Provide a summary of the actions taken and the current status.</li>
        <li>Inform the customer about the expected resolution time if the issue was escalated.</li>
        <li>Ensure the customer has the support ticket number for reference.</li>
        <li>Offer additional assistance if needed, such as scheduling follow-up calls.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>7. Preventative Measures</h3>
    <p>Educate the customer on tips to prevent future service interruptions:</p>
    
    <ul>
