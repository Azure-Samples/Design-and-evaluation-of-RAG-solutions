    <h1>Rebooting Fiber Optic Connections</h1>
    <p>Fiber optic connections are a critical component of modern telecommunications, providing high-speed internet and reliable connections. This guide is designed to assist QuickConnect customer service agents in supporting customers who need to reboot their fiber optic connections. Rebooting a fiber optic connection can help resolve a variety of connectivity issues, including slow speeds and dropped connections. Follow the steps provided in this guide to effectively assist customers.</p>

    <h2>Common Reasons for Rebooting Fiber Optic Connections</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Slow Internet Speeds:</strong> Customers may experience a slowdown in their internet speed due to congestion or technical issues.</li>
        <li><strong>Connectivity Drops:</strong> Frequent disconnections can be a sign that a reboot is needed.</li>
        <li><strong>Failed Firmware Updates:</strong> Sometimes, firmware updates do not complete successfully and require a reboot.</li>
        <li><strong>Network Congestion:</strong> Heavy usage spikes can cause temporary disconnects, resolved by a reboot.</li>
        <li><strong>Hardware Malfunctions:</strong> Issues with the Optical Network Terminal (ONT) or router.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step-by-Step Guide to Rebooting a Fiber Optic Connection</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Verify Customer Information:</strong> Ensure that you have the customer's account information and verify their identity before proceeding with any troubleshooting.</li>
        <li><strong>Identify the Equipment:</strong> Determine whether the customer is using an Optical Network Terminal (ONT) and router, or a combined unit.</li>
        <li><strong>Instruct the Customer to Locate the ONT and Router:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>The ONT is usually a box installed inside the home, often near where the fiber optic cable enters.</li>
                <li>The router is typically a separate device connected to the ONT via an Ethernet cable.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Power Down the Equipment:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>Instruct the customer to unplug the power cable from both the ONT and the router.</li>
                <li>Wait at least 30 seconds to ensure that all residual power has drained.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Power Up the ONT:</strong> 
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Plug in the power cable to the ONT and wait for the indicator lights to stabilize. This may take a few minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Power Up the Router:</strong> 
            <ol type="a">
                <li>Once the ONT lights stabilize, plug in the router.</li>
                <li>Wait for the router to go through its startup process. This includes synchronizing with the ONT and may take a few minutes.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li><strong>Verify Connection:</strong> 
            <ul>
                <li>Once both devices are powered up, advise the customer to check their internet connection on a device (e.g., smartphone, laptop).</li>
                <li>If issues persist, proceed with additional troubleshooting steps.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ol>
