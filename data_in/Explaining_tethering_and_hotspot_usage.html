<h1>Understanding Tethering and Hotspot Usage</h1>

<p>Welcome to the QuickConnect customer service guide on tethering and hotspot usage. This document is designed to help you assist customers with their queries about using their device as a tethering hotspot. Let's dive in!</p>

<h2>What is Tethering and Hotspot?</h2>

<p>Tethering and hotspot are methods to share your mobile device's internet connection with other devices, such as laptops, tablets, or other smartphones. Here's a brief overview:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Tethering:</strong> The process of sharing your mobile device's internet connection with another device, using a USB cable, Bluetooth, or Wi-Fi.</li>
    <li><strong>Hotspot:</strong> Creating a Wi-Fi network using your mobile device, allowing other devices to connect and access the internet through your mobile data connection.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Types of Tethering</h2>

<p>There are three main types of tethering:</p>

<h3>1. USB Tethering</h3>
<p>USB tethering involves connecting your mobile device to a computer using a USB cable. It is generally the fastest and most reliable method.</p>

<h3>2. Bluetooth Tethering</h3>
<p>Bluetooth tethering allows your mobile device to share its internet connection with another device over Bluetooth. This method is slower than USB and Wi-Fi tethering, but it can be useful if USB ports are unavailable.</p>

<h3>3. Wi-Fi Hotspot</h3>
<p>A Wi-Fi hotspot allows your mobile device to create a wireless network that other devices can connect to. It's convenient and can connect multiple devices at once.</p>

<h2>Setting Up a Mobile Hotspot</h2>

<p>Here's a step-by-step guide to help customers set up a mobile hotspot on their devices:</p>

<h3>For Android Devices:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li>
    <li>Tap on <strong>Network & Internet</strong>.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Hotspot & tethering</strong>.</li>
    <li>Tap on <strong>Wi-Fi hotspot</strong>.</li>
    <li>Toggle the switch to turn on the Wi-Fi hotspot.</li>
    <li>Customers can set up their hotspot name (SSID) and password by tapping on <strong>Set up Wi-Fi hotspot</strong>.</li>
</ol>

<h3>For iOS Devices:</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Open the <strong>Settings</strong> app.</li>
