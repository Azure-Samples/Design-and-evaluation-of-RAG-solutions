        <h2>Introduction to Dark Fiber Networks</h2>
        <p>Dark fiber refers to unused optical fiber infrastructure, such as cables, that has been laid but is not currently active or lit by service providers. Originally, fiber-optic networks were expanded rapidly, anticipating future demand, resulting in excess fiber capacity. This unused fiber is referred to as 'dark fiber'. Organizations can lease or purchase this dark fiber to create their own private networks.</p>

        <h3>Key Points</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding dark fiber networks</li>
            <li>Benefits of dark fiber</li>
            <li>Common use cases</li>
            <li>Potential challenges</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Understanding Dark Fiber Networks</h2>
        <p>Dark fiber network operation involves the following components and concepts:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Fiber-Optic Cables:</strong> These are the actual physical cables that consist of glass or plastic fibers, which transmit data as light pulses.</li>
            <li><strong>Transceivers:</strong> Devices that send and receive data over fiber-optic lines.</li>
            <li><strong>Optical Amplifiers:</strong> These devices boost signal strength without converting the signal to an electrical one.</li>
            <li><strong>Wavelength Division Multiplexing (WDM):</strong> This technique allows multiple signals to be sent on the same fiber strand in different wavelengths (colors) of light.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Benefits of Dark Fiber Networks</h2>
        <p>Dark fiber networks offer several advantages, including:</p>
