        <h2 id="intro">Introduction to Dual-Band Routers</h2>
        <p>
            Dual-band routers are advanced networking devices that operate on two different frequency bands: 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz. They offer multiple advantages, such as enhanced performance, reduced interference, and better flexibility for multiple devices. Understanding the basics of dual-band routers can help you provide better service to customers.

        <h2 id="setting-up">Step-by-Step Setup Guide</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to help the customers set up their dual-band routers:</p>

        <h3>1. Unbox and Connect Hardware</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Unbox the router and ensure all components are present, including the router unit, power adapter, Ethernet cables, and setup guide.</li>
            <li>Connect the router to the modem using an Ethernet cable.</li>
            <li>Power on the router by plugging in the power adapter and turning on the device.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2. Access the Router’s Web Interface</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect a computer to the router using another Ethernet cable or via Wi-Fi using the default SSID (network name) and password found on the router label.</li>
            <li>Open a web browser and enter the router’s IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1) in the address bar.</li>
            <li>Log in using the default credentials (usually "admin" for both username and password).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3. Configure Basic Settings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Change the default login credentials for enhanced security.</li>
            <li>Set up the router’s SSID and password for both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>4. Optimize Router Settings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Select optimal channels for both frequency bands to minimize interference.</li>
            <li>Adjust the bandwidth settings according to customer needs (20 MHz, 40 MHz for 2.4 GHz; 20 MHz, 40 MHz, 80 MHz for 5 GHz).</li>
            <li>Enable guest networks if the customer wants to provide internet access to visitors without sharing the main network credentials.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>5. Complete the Setup</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Save the changes and reboot the router.</li>
            <li>Reconnect devices to the newly configured SSID and test the connection.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="faq">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
        <h3>1. What is the benefit of using a dual-band router?</h3>
        <p>
            Dual-band routers offer the flexibility to connect devices to either the 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz band. The 2.4 GHz band is typically used for broader coverage, suitable for activities such as web browsing. The 5 GHz band offers higher speeds and is ideal for bandwidth-intensive tasks like streaming HD content and online gaming.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Can I use both bands simultaneously?</h3>
        <p>
            Yes, dual-band routers allow simultaneous use of both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands, enabling multiple devices to connect and operate efficiently on the best-suited frequency.
        </p>

        <h3>3. How do I choose the right channel for my router?</h3>
        <p>
            Most routers come with an auto-channel selection feature, but you can manually choose channels with the least interference. Tools like Wi-Fi analyzer apps can help identify the best channels for optimal performance.
        </p>

        <h3>4. What should I do if my internet speed is slow?</h3>
        <p>
            First, check if the router is placed in an optimal location, away from physical obstructions and electronic devices that might cause interference. Additionally, update the router's firmware and consider upgrading your internet plan if required.
        </p>

        <h3>5. Do all devices support dual-band Wi-Fi?</h3>
        <p>
            Not all devices support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz bands. Ensure the customer's devices are compatible with the desired frequency to avoid connectivity issues.
