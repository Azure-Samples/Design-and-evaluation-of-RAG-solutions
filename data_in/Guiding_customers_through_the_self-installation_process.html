        <h1>QuickConnect: Guiding Customers Through the Self-Installation Process</h1>
        
        <p>As a customer service agent at QuickConnect, you'll frequently assist customers in setting up their home internet and cable services through our self-installation process. This guide provides a step-by-step approach to help you effectively guide customers and address common issues they might encounter.</p>
        
        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>The self-installation process allows customers to set up their QuickConnect services without the need for a technician visit. This can save time and provide convenience, but some customers may require assistance. Your role is to guide them through the process, ensuring they understand each step and feel confident in their ability to complete the setup.</p>
        
        <h2>2. Pre-Installation Preparation</h2>
        <p>Before customers begin the self-installation process, ensure they have:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>All necessary equipment (modem, router, cables, power adapter, etc.)</li>
            <li>Installation guide provided in their QuickConnect package</li>
            <li>A sufficient internet connection via a smartphone or another device to access online instructions or contact support if needed</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>3. Initial Setup</h2>
        <p>Guide customers through setting up their equipment. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:</p>
        
        <h3>3.1 Connecting the Modem</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Locate a suitable spot close to a coaxial cable outlet and a power outlet.</li>
            <li>Connect the modem to the coaxial cable outlet using the provided coaxial cable.</li>
            <li>Plug the modem into a power outlet using the power adapter and turn it on.</li>
            <li>Wait for the modem to establish a connection. This may take up to 5 minutes. The lights on the modem should stop blinking and show a steady "Online" indicator.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>3.2 Connecting the Router</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Connect the modem to the router using an Ethernet cable. Plug one end of the cable into the modem and the other end into the "Internet" or "WAN" port on the router.</li>
            <li>Plug the router into a power outlet using the power adapter and turn it on.</li>
            <li>Wait for the router to power up. The "Internet" or "WAN" light should turn green, indicating a successful connection.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>4. Configuring the Network</h2>
        <p>After physically setting up the equipment, the customer will need to configure their network settings. Provide the following instructions:</p>
        
        <h3>4.1 Connecting Devices to the Network</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>On a smartphone or computer, go to the Wi-Fi settings.</li>
            <li>Find and select the network name (SSID) that matches the one on their QuickConnect router.</li>
            <li>Enter the Wi-Fi password provided in the QuickConnect package.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>4.2 Accessing the Router's Web Interface</h3>
        <p>Explain how to access the router's web administration interface for further configuration, if necessary:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a web browser on a connected device.</li>
            <li>Enter the router's IP address into the address bar (commonly <code>192.168.1.1</code> or <code>192.168.0.1</code>).</li>
            <li>Log in using the default username and password (usually both are "admin" or as specified in the QuickConnect guide).</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>5. Activating QuickConnect Services</h2>
        <p>Customers need to activate their services through the QuickConnect activation portal. Guide them through the following steps:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Open a web browser and visit the QuickConnect activation page (e.g., <code>activate.quickconnect.com</code>).</li>
            <li>Follow the on-screen instructions to enter their account number and activation code (found in their QuickConnect welcome package).</li>
            <li>Complete the activation process by verifying their installation and setting up their QuickConnect account if prompted.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2>6. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>

        </ul>
        
        <h3>6.4 Activation Issues</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure they are using the correct activation code and account number.</li>
            <li>Advise them to clear their browser cache and retry the activation process.</li>
