    <h2>Detailed Troubleshooting Steps</h2>
    <h3>1. Login Issues</h3>
    <p>Customers may encounter difficulties logging into their webmail accounts due to forgotten passwords, incorrect usernames, or account lockouts. Here are the steps to resolve login issues:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask the customer to double-check the accuracy of their username and password.</li>
        <li>If the credentials are correct, advise the customer to perform a password reset via the "Forgot Password" link.</li>
        <li>Ensure the customer is aware of any account lockout policies due to multiple failed login attempts and advise on waiting time or unlocking procedures.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>2. Email Sending Failures</h3>
    <p>When customers report issues with sending emails, it is often due to incorrect SMTP settings or network issues. Follow these steps to assist customers:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Verify that the customer's SMTP server settings (hostname, port, security type) are correct and match QuickConnect's configuration requirements.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the customer’s email client is not being blocked by firewall or antivirus software.</li>
        <li>Advise the customer to check for any error messages and provide those details to better diagnose the issue.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Not Receiving Emails</h3>
    <p>This issue can stem from various reasons, including mailbox limitations, misconfigured email filters, or spam settings. To address this, follow these steps:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Ask the customer to check their spam or junk folder for the missing emails and mark them as “Not Spam” if found there.</li>
        <li>Guide the customer on how to adjust their email filters and whitelist important sender addresses.</li>
        <li>Verify that the customer’s mailbox is not full and assist them in deleting old emails to free up space if necessary.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4. Attachment Issues</h3>
    <p>Problems with attachments are common and typically result from size limitations or unsupported file types. Steps to resolve these issues include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Check the size of the attachment and ensure it is within the acceptable limits (typically 25MB for most services).</li>
        <li>Advise the customer to compress large files into zip archives or use file-sharing services for extensive attachments.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the file type is supported by the webmail service and suggest alternative formats if needed.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>5. Slow Webmail Performance</h3>
    <p>Performance issues can be caused by various factors, including browser cache, network speed, or heavy scripts running in the background. Steps to enhance webmail performance include:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Instruct the customer to clear their browser cache and cookies.</li>
        <li>Suggest using a different browser to see if the issue persists.</li>
        <li>Explain how to check network connection speeds and stability.</li>
        <li>Advise on disabling unnecessary browser extensions or add-ons that may slow down performance.</li>
    </ol>
