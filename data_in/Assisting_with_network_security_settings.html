        <h2 id="wifi-security">1. Wi-Fi Security Settings</h2>
        <p>Wi-Fi security is the first line of defense against unauthorized access. The following steps will guide you through helping a customer secure their Wi-Fi network.</p>
        
        <h3>Selecting a Secure Encryption Method</h3>
        <p>Modern Wi-Fi routers support various encryption methods. The most common and secure options are:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>WPA3:</b> The latest and most secure standard.</li>
            <li><b>WPA2:</b> Still widely used, provides robust security.</li>
            <li><b>WEP:</b> Obsolete and not recommended.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Changing the Default SSID</h3>
        <p>A default SSID can make a network a target. Encourage customers to choose a unique SSID that doesn’t disclose personal information.</p>
        
        <h3>Setting a Strong Password</h3>
        <p>Advise customers to set a strong, complex password. A good password includes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>At least 12 characters</li>
            <li>A mix of upper and lower case letters</li>
            <li>Numbers and special characters</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Accessing Wi-Fi Settings</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open a web browser and enter the router’s IP address (commonly 192.168.1.1 or 192.168.0.1).</li>
            <li>Log in with the router’s username and password (often found on the router or in the manual).</li>
            <li>Navigate to the Wireless settings section.</li>
            <li>Select the desired encryption method (preferably WPA3 or WPA2).</li>
            <li>Change the SSID to a unique name.</li>
            <li>Set a strong password following the guidelines mentioned above.</li>
            <li>Save the settings and reboot the router if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h2 id="firewall-settings">2. Firewall Configuration</h2>
        <p>A firewall helps protect the network from external threats. It monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on security rules.</p>
        
        <h3>Understanding Firewalls</h3>
        <p>There are two main types of firewalls:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Hardware Firewalls:</b> Found in routers or standalone devices. Ideal for protecting entire networks.</li>
            <li><b>Software Firewalls:</b> Installed on individual devices. Good for additional security on PCs and other devices.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Basic Firewall Configuration</h3>
        <p>Assist customers in configuring their firewall with the following steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Access the router’s settings (refer to the Wi-Fi settings section for login instructions).</li>
            <li>Navigate to the Firewall or Security settings section.</li>
            <li>Ensure the firewall is enabled.</li>
            <li>Configure basic rules, such as blocking known malicious IP addresses and restricting certain ports.</li>
            <li>Save the settings and reboot the router if necessary.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Advanced Firewall Configuration</h3>
        <p>For advanced users, provide guidance on setting up more detailed rules:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Creating custom rules for specific applications</li>
            <li>Setting up DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) for isolated devices</li>
            <li>Implementing VPNs (Virtual Private Networks) for secure remote access</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 id="best-practices">3. Best Practices for Network Security</h2>
        <p>In addition to securing Wi-Fi and configuring firewalls, educate customers on best practices for maintaining network security:</p>
        
        <h3>Regular Firmware Updates</h3>
        <p>Encourage customers to regularly check for and install firmware updates for their routers and devices to patch vulnerabilities.</p>
        
        <h3>Disabling WPS</h3>
        <p>WPS (Wi-Fi Protected Setup) can be convenient but is often vulnerable to attacks. Advise customers to disable WPS in their router settings.</p>
        
        <h3>Guest Networks</h3>
        <p>Setting up a guest network isolates visitors’ devices from the main network, enhancing security.</p>
        
        <h3>Monitoring Network Activity</h3>
        <p>Recommend using network monitoring tools to detect unusual activity. Many routers provide built-in monitoring features.</p>
        
        <h3>Strong Passwords for All Accounts</h3>
        <p>Remind customers to use strong, unique passwords for their router's admin account and other critical accounts.</p>
        
        <h2 id="troubleshooting">4. Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
        <p>Here are solutions to common network security issues customers may face:</p>
        
        <h3>Cannot Access Router Settings</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the customer is connected to the network.</li>
            <li>Check if the IP address used is correct. It’s often printed on the router.</li>
            <li>Ask the customer to try different browsers or clear their browser cache.</li>
            <li>Advise resetting the router to factory settings as a last resort, but inform them this will erase all configurations.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Forgotten Wi-Fi Password</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Customers can access the router settings and view/change the Wi-Fi password.</li>
            <li>Resetting the router to factory settings will restore the default password.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Weak Signal</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Suggest relocating the router for better coverage.</li>
            <li>Check for interferences from other devices or networks.</li>
            <li>Consider using Wi-Fi extenders or mesh networks for large areas.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Network is Compromised</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Advise changing all passwords immediately.</li>
            <li>Check for firmware updates and install them.</li>
            <li>Review and tighten firewall rules.</li>
            <li>Consider setting up a VPN for secure communication.</li>
        </ul>
