        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
            QuickConnect uses a hybrid fiber-coaxial (HFC) network to deliver high-speed internet connectivity to our customers. This system combines the speed of fiber optic cables with the coverage capabilities 
            of traditional coaxial cables to provide robust and reliable service.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a customer service agent, you'll be responsible for addressing various queries, from basic troubleshooting to more complex technical problems. This document will equip you with the necessary knowledge 
            and tools to support our customers effectively.

        <h3>Understanding Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial (HFC)</h3>
        <p>
            Hybrid Fiber-Coaxial (HFC) networks use both fiber optic and coaxial cables. These systems are designed to take advantage of the strengths of both technologies:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Fiber Optic Cables:</strong> Used primarily for long-distance communication due to their high bandwidth and speed. They form the backbone of the HFC network, connecting central hubs with regional nodes.</li>
            <li><strong>Coaxial Cables:</strong> Used for the last mile delivery to homes and businesses. They are flexible, durable, and can easily be integrated into existing infrastructures.</li>
        </ul>

    <section id="common-queries">
        <h3>Common Customer Queries and How to Handle Them</h3>
        <h4>1. No Internet Connection</h4>
        <p>When a customer reports no internet connection, follow these steps to diagnose and resolve the issue:</p>
        
        <table class="status-table">
            <tr>
                <th>Steps</th>
                <th>Details</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Step 1</td>
                <td>Check if there's an outage in the area using the network status dashboard.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Step 2</td>
                <td>Ask the customer to reboot their modem and router.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Step 3</td>
                <td>If the problem persists, guide the customer to check cable connections on the modem and router.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Step 4</td>
                <td>Run a remote diagnostic test to identify any faults in the network or the customer's equipment.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h4>2. Slow Internet Speed</h4>
        <p>Issues with internet speed can be frustrating. The following procedures can help ensure the customer regains their expected performance:</p>

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Check for Network Congestion:</strong> Ask the customer if the slowdown occurs at certain times of the day and if multiple devices are connected.</li>
            <li><strong>Test Wired vs. Wireless:</strong> Have the customer test their connection with a wired device directly connected to the modem. Wireless interference might be the cause.</li>
            <li><strong>Upgrade Equipment:</strong> Older modems and routers might not support high-speed connections. Check if the customer’s equipment is up-to-date.</li>
            <li><strong>Background Usage:</strong> Remind the customer that downloading or streaming in the background can affect speeds.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>3. Frequent Disconnections</h4>
        <p>To handle complaints about frequent disconnections, consider these actions:</p>

        <ol>
            <li>Check the modem and router status. Ask the customer to note if any indicator lights are flashing or red.</li>
            <li>Ensure all cable connections are secure and undamaged.</li>
            <li>Ask the customer to perform a power cycle on their modem and router (unplugging, waiting for a few seconds, and then plugging them back in).</li>
            <li>
                Use remote diagnostics tools to detect any signal instability or potential issues in the neighborhood's HFC network.
                If unresolved, schedule a technician visit.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Advanced Troubleshooting Tips</h3>
        <p>
            Sometimes standard procedures may not fix the issue. Here are some advanced troubleshooting tips:
        </p>
        
        <h4>Signal Strength and Quality</h4>
        <p>
            Signal strength and quality are critical for optimal performance:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Use the diagnostic tools to check if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and power levels are within the recommended range.</li>
            <li>If power levels are too high or too low, an attenuator might be needed to balance the signal.</li>
            <li>Check for noise ingress, which might affect signal quality. This can often be caused by faulty coaxial cables or connectors.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Modem Configuration</h4>
        <p>
            Ensure the customer's modem is correctly configured:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Verify the modem's firmware is up-to-date. Sometimes, outdated firmware can cause connectivity issues.</li>
            <li>Check the modem’s event logs for any recurrent errors or warnings.</li>
            <li>Ensure the modem is provisioned correctly with the proper service profile matching the customer's subscription plan.</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Network Equipment Compatibility</h4>
        <p>
            Compatibility between different pieces of network equipment is essential:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the modem and router are compatible with each other and support the bandwidth requirements of the customer's plan.</li>
            <li>If the customer is using third-party equipment, confirm that it meets the standards for HFC networks.</li>
            <li>Suggest using branded equipment recommended by QuickConnect for optimal performance.</li>
        </ul>
