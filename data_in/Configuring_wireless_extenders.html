        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction to Wireless Extenders</h2>
        <p>Wireless extenders, also known as range extenders or repeaters, are devices used to expand the reach of a Wi-Fi network. They help eliminate dead zones and provide a stronger signal in areas that are far from the main router. By extending wireless coverage, customers can enjoy a more reliable connection throughout their homes or offices.</p>
        
        <h2 id="preparation">Preparation</h2>
        <p>Before configuring a wireless extender, ensure you and the customer have the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A wireless extender compatible with their existing router.</li>
            <li>The SSID (network name) and password of their existing Wi-Fi network.</li>
            <li>An internet-connected device (e.g., laptop, smartphone) to perform the setup.</li>
            <li>Access to a power outlet near the area where the extender will be placed.</li>
            <li>The extender's user manual or Quick Start Guide.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="setup">Setup Steps</h2>
        <p>Follow these steps to configure a wireless extender:</p>
        
        <h3>Step 1: Plug in the Extender</h3>
        <p>Connect the wireless extender to a power outlet halfway between the router and the area with weak Wi-Fi signal. Ensure it is within the range of the existing Wi-Fi network.</p>

        <h3>Step 2: Connecting to the Extender's Network</h3>
        <p>Using a laptop or smartphone, connect to the extender's default Wi-Fi network. This SSID should be listed in the user manual or on the extender itself. The network may be unsecured or require a default password.</p>

        <h3>Step 3: Accessing the Extender's Setup Page</h3>
        <p>Open a web browser and enter the extender's IP address. If the IP address is unknown, it is typically listed in the user manual or can be found by checking the connected device's network information. Common IP addresses for extenders are <code>192.168.1.1</code> or <code>192.168.0.1</code>.</p>

        <h3>Step 4: Logging In</h3>
        <p>You will be prompted to log in to the extender's setup page. The default username and password are usually <code>admin/admin</code> or <code>admin/password</code>. Refer to the user manual for the exact login credentials if needed.</p>
        
        <h3>Step 5: Configuring the Extender</h3>
        <p>Once logged in, follow the on-screen instructions to set up the extender. Typically, it involves the following steps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Selecting the option to extend an existing Wi-Fi network.</li>
            <li>Choosing the customer's Wi-Fi network from a list of available networks.</li>
            <li>Entering the network password (Wi-Fi key).</li>
            <li>Configuring the extended network settings, such as SSID and password (some extenders create a new network name, while others use the existing one with a suffix like "_EXT").</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Step 6: Completing the Setup</h3>
        <p>After configuring the settings, apply the changes and restart the extender if prompted. The extender should now connect to the existing Wi-Fi network and extend its coverage. Verify this by checking if the newly extended network signal is strong in previously weak areas.</p>

        <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
        <p>If the customer encounters issues during or after setup, here are some common solutions:</p>
        <h3>Common Issues and Resolutions</h3>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Issue</th>
                <th>Possible Solution</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Extender not connecting to the network</td>
                <td>Ensure the extender is within the router's range. Re-enter the Wi-Fi password correctly. Reduce interference from other electronic devices.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Unable to access the extender's setup page</td>
                <td>Check if the device is properly connected to the extender's network. Verify the IP address. Reboot the extender and try again.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Weak signal even after setup</td>
                <td>Reposition the extender closer to the router. Ensure there are no large obstacles between the router, extender, and the area of use.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Frequent disconnections</td>
                <td>Update the extenders firmware. Ensure other devices are not heavily occupying the network bandwidth. Perform a power cycle on both the router and extender.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h2 id="tips">Optimization Tips</h2>
        <p>To ensure optimal performance of wireless extenders, here are some best practices:</p>
        <h3>Positioning Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Place the extender halfway between the router and the area with weak Wi-Fi signal.</li>
            <li>Avoid placing the extender in dead zones. Ensure it is within the router's operating range.</li>
            <li>Keep the extender away from electronic devices that can cause interference, such as microwave ovens, baby monitors, and cordless phones.</li>
            <li>Position the extender in an elevated area to reduce obstacles and improve signal strength.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Technical Tips</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure the extender’s firmware is up to date. Check the manufacturer’s website for the latest version.</li>
            <li>Use dual-band extenders that support both 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies to reduce congestion and increase speed.</li>
            <li>Enable WPA3 encryption for added security, if supported by the extender and router.</li>
            <li>Ensure that the extender's SSID is easily distinguishable to avoid confusion with the main network.</li>
            <li>Limit the number of devices connected to the extender to avoid overloading it.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h3>Maintaining Network Security</h3>
