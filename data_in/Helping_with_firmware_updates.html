        <h2>Understanding Firmware</h2>
        <p>Firmware is a specific class of computer software that provides low-level control for a device's specific hardware. Firmware is typically stored in the device's flash memory and is essential for the hardware to function correctly. Firmware updates can enhance device functionality, improve security, and fix bugs.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="preparing-for-update">
        <h2>Preparing for a Firmware Update</h2>
        <p>Before performing a firmware update, it is important to prepare appropriately:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Ensure that the customer has a stable power supply and an uninterrupted internet connection.</li>
            <li>Advise the customer to back up important data, as firmware updates can sometimes result in data loss.</li>
            <li>Verify the current firmware version of the device. This can usually be found in the device settings under “About” or “System Information.”</li>
            <li>Inform the customer about the expected duration of the update.</li>
        </ul>
    </section>

    <section id="performing-the-update">
        <h2>Performing the Firmware Update</h2>
        <p>Follow these general steps to help the customer perform a firmware update. Note that the exact process may vary based on the device model.</p>
        <h3>Step-by-Step Guide</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Access the device settings: Guide the customer to navigate to the device's settings menu.
            </li>
            <li>Locate the firmware update option: In the settings menu, look for options like “Software Update,” “Firmware Update,” or “System Update.”</li>
            <li>Check for updates: Direct the customer to select the option to check for available updates. The system will typically display a message if an update is available along with relevant details.</li>
            <li>Download the update: Instruct the customer to start the download process. Emphasize the importance of maintaining a stable internet connection during this period.</li>
            <li>Install the update: Once the download is complete, the customer should be prompted to install the update. Advise them to select "Install" and confirm any prompts.</li>
            <li>Wait for the installation to complete: Ensure that the customer does not turn off the device or disconnect it from its power source during the installation. The device may reboot several times during the update process.</li>
        </ol>
