        <h1>Understanding the Principles of Net Neutrality</h1>
        <p>Net neutrality is the principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without discrimination or differential charging by Internet Service Providers (ISPs) based on user, content, website, platform, application, type of equipment, or method of communication. This document aims to provide QuickConnect customer service agents with a comprehensive understanding of net neutrality, enabling them to assist customers effectively with queries related to the topic.</p>
        
        <h2>What is Net Neutrality?</h2>
        <p>Net neutrality is based on the idea that the internet is an open platform where users have the freedom to access any service or content they prefer, without undue interference from ISPs. It ensures that ISPs cannot throttle, block, or prioritize certain types of content over others. This principle promotes innovation, competition, and free expression online.</p>

        <h2>Key Principles of Net Neutrality</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Principle</th>
                <th>Description</th>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Equal Treatment of Data</td>
                <td>All internet data should be treated equally, regardless of its source, destination, or content. ISPs should not favor or block specific websites or services.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No Discrimination</td>
                <td>ISPs should not give preferential treatment to certain types of data, such as videos or VoIP, over others. This ensures a level playing field for all content providers.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No Throttling</td>
                <td>ISPs should not intentionally slow down specific types of data or user access to particular websites or services.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>No Paid Prioritization</td>
                <td>ISPs should not create "fast lanes" for companies that can pay more, giving them better access or faster delivery of their services over others.</td>
            </tr>
        </table>

        <h3>Why is Net Neutrality Important?</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Promotes Innovation</li>
            <li>Ensures Fair Competition</li>
            <li>Protects Consumer Choice</li>
            <li>Supports Free Expression</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>Net neutrality is crucial because it ensures that startups and smaller companies have the same chance to succeed as established giants. Without it, new businesses could be pushed out because they can't afford to pay for faster delivery of their content.</p>

        <p>The legal status of net neutrality can vary by country, and it is often a subject of intense debate and legislative action. Here are some developments from around the world:</p>

                <td>EU regulations enforce net neutrality principles, including no blocking, no throttling, and transparency requirements for ISPs.</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>India</td>
                <td>Enforced</td>
                <td>India's Telecom Regulatory Authority issued strong net neutrality rules in 2018, prohibiting discriminatory treatment of internet content.</td>
